# CoinCollection
This application can be built, but not successfully run without your device being added in the Firebase console. Because of this, I will include a compiled apk or add your device to the Firebase upon request.

To test the functionality of this app you will first need to login with a Google account.
Then you should scan, search by serial number, and manually enter the following test coins.

After that, you can try taking pictures of the obverse and reverse. Then you can click on the coins from the home page to view their information and edit/delete them.
